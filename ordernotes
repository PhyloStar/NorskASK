This thesis presents the first results for the Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
task on the ASK corpus of Norwegian learner language. It explores a wide
variety of classifier architectures, including linear models, simple neural
networks (MLPs) and more specialized neural architectures, namely
convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, it explores
training an AES model using multi-task learning, with Native Language
Identification (NLI) as an auxiliary task. Three different formulations of
the AES task are explored: nominal classification, regression and ordinal
regression. A number of model hyperparameters are investigated, such as the
performance of attention-based architectures compared to simpler pooling
methods: mean-over-time and max-over-time.
