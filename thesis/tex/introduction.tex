\chapter{Introduction}

\todo{lifted from ACL submission}
In this paper we present first results for the task of Automated Essay
Scoring for Norwegian learner language. We analyze a number of properties of
this task experimentally and assess (i) the formulation of the task as either
regression or classification, (ii) the use of various non-neural and neural
machine learning architectures with various types of input representations,
and (iii) applying multi-task learning for joint prediction of essay scoring
and native language identification. We find that a GRU-based attention model
trained in a single-task setting performs best at the AES task.

\todo{Moved from bkg chap}
This thesis will be focused on training automated essay scoring models on
Norwegian data. We will experiment with various linear and neural machine
learning models. We will try using different input features and combinations
of these, and do limited exploration of the hyperparameter space of our
models.

Finally, we will train some of our models with multi-task learning, using
\ac{NLI} as an auxiliary task. As far as we know, this task combination has
not been attempted in previous work \todo{verify}.
