In this paper we present first results for the task of Automated Essay
Scoring for Norwegian learner language. We analyze a number of properties of
this task experimentally and assess (i) the formulation of the task as either
regression or classification, (ii) the use of various non-neural and neural
machine learning architectures with various types of input representations,
and (iii) applying multi-task learning for joint prediction of essay scoring
and native language identification. We find that a GRU-based attention model
trained in a single-task setting performs best at the AES task.
